ðŸ’¡ **Reason this blog was created** 

I started this repo bacause I wanted to practise what I was learning during my first weeks of foundation at EDA bootcamp. 

I believe it was a great way to start with the right foot and invest some time working on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

ðŸš© **Challenges** 

While setting up the repo I had some difficulties as I was quite new at using GitHub:
 
- I got lost on the git commands, and it took me more time than I expected to get used to commit regularly. 
- Also, I tended to work on CSS and JavaScript at the same time which made it hard to come up simple names that explain what I did.
- Another challege that I face was implementing the dropdown menu. When I starting writing blog post I thought it would be nice to have a cool dropdown on hover menu tab. However, I started googling and realised there was a lot of CSS involved which required me to do a lot of troubleshooting until I got it to work. 

ðŸ“– **This is an open source project** 

I love the idea of open source projects. This is a nice way to support each other collaboratively and make our projects better.
