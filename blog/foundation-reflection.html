          Reflection utilising my journal findings and the Core learnings.
        </h1>
        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
          as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>

        <p>
          After going through the core learning of foundation, I have learnt
          many new things about myself and my ego specially the relationship
          between the parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realised that even though I am patient with others’ learning
          processes, and I can give advice to them on how to approach certain
          frustration or difficulties, I am not like that with myself, and I
          tend to put very high expectations on me. This is, of course, an
          unhealthy habit and it usually has a terrible effect on my self-esteem
          leading to feeling depressed and incapable of success. Moreover, when
          I feel overwhelmed or tired, I don’t usually pay attention to it,
          thinking that it is a normal thing that comes with any job. However, I
          have never thought it was because of the lack of planned breaks, short
          walks around or a chat with someone. Last but not least, I realised I
          can be more proactive when I plan my days and weeks ahead, leaving
          time for meals, breaks, friends and duties I may have; instead of
          going with the flow of day after day.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core learning gave me the necessary tools to realise and change
          certain habits that even though weren’t working for me, I couldn’t see
          them. It also helped me to change many sides of my learning process by
          learning just in time, using the word “yet” because anything I want to
          do is possible, doing an introspective view of myself and my best way
          of learning.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are the role of values,empathy and self-awareness in learning and
          programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The roles of these abilities is fundamental in both learning and
          programming as they set the basic foundations to live with other
          people. Values will help us make ethical decisions; empathy will allow
          us to put ourselves on other people’s shoes and self-awareness will
          enable us to recognise our strength and challenges and to speak up if
          we need help.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we can see, these concepts are important because they give us the
          chance to collaborate with others’ learning process, projects and
          become better human beings who are able to support people when needed.
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          What surprised me the most was to learn that we can change many aspect
          of our lives if we want. With the right information and tools, we can
          reprogrammed our habits, routines, train our brains, learn new things,
          become whatever we want, and all we need is the willing to do
          something and stick to it specially during hard times cause that is
          the crucial part to achieve our goals.
        </p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging part for me was to write a blog post telling my
          strength and challenging part because it was a very personal task. I
          have done a similar activity but it was from a professional point of
          view, reflecting on ways I have planned my lessons, interacted with
          students, things like that. However, I liked the challenge and enjoyed
          the way, if I haven’t been asked to do this, probably I would have
          never put time aside to reflect on them.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think the reason is because many of the students who enrol to this
          web development bootcamp course are looking for a career change, as
          the result you need to make sure everyone has a certain mindset while
          learning and coding. Moreover, nowadays being able to programme in any
          language is not the only skill required by companies as most of the
          tech industry jobs need people to work as a team. Last but not least,
          as a programming school, you need to know what are our needs,
          challenges and moment of frustrations, among others in order to
          provide us the necessary support while learning.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning it felt weird having to post my thoughts, feeling and
          learning achievements either on GitHub or blog; but then I kind of
          like to read everybody’s post on their blogs, and get the feeling that
          I know them a bit more. I think the time I spent reading the core
          learning part paid of since I have learnt a lot about the way I can
          help myself and others to succeed. I even started reading one of the
          books that was mentioned on the core part because I found it
          intriguing.
