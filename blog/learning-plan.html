        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>Long Term Goal.</h2>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to become an experience full-stack developer, I
          would like to be able to get a job where I can perform, grow, learn
          and contribute with my knowledge and experience to the company’s
          success. Therefore, my plan as a career pathway is to start as a
          junior, earn experience and knowledge in the industry and after a few
          years move forward to become a senior developer.
        </p>
        <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
        <p>
          To achieve my goal, I will take advantage of my soft skills like
          communication which will be useful to communicate effectively among
          the cohort, facilitators and other stakeholders. I really enjoy
          working as part of a team as well in order to collaborate, learn and
          successfully deliver projects on time. Last but not least, I am
          self-managed and motivated, as a self-taught developer, I have to do a
          lot of research and self-study, reach for help to third-parties in
          order to understand fully what I am studying. However, I always
          consider it as an opportunity to grow and learn as a professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          * What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see
          developed in myself while at EDA?
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to know when I can bother a classmate/ facilitator for
          help and how to approach them both online and f2f. Being able to
          prioritised while coding and how to cope with feeling overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          On other hand, as a human-being, I have some limitations while
          learning. I love studying in the morning as I feel I am more
          productive and can concentrate better. However, winter is coming!!!
          and it will be quite hard for me to get up and sit on the desk or go
          to campus. Also, I am a bit of a perfectionist so I am working
          extremely hard to stick to the time-box and avoid hanging around
          details that are not very important at the moment. Last but not least,
          I find it difficult to take breaks if I’m too deep into an activity.
          Usually I remember to take a break when my arm is hacking, somebody
          calls on my phone or I’m hungry; otherwise, I just go with the flow.
          To sum up, I need to work harder on this but I am sure that with my
          perseverance and planning as well as with my classmates’ and
          facilitators’ help, I will be able to do it.
        </p>
        <h2>Managing my workloads</h2>
        <p>
          In order to keep my mind and body healthy, I commit myself to save
          time for running and training and keep my diet varied. In order to
          keep myself out of eating gluten and diary, at home I plan the meals I
          want to eat 1 week ahead in order to go to the supermarket and buy
          only what is necessary. Regarding my learning process, I plan to study
          everyday including weekends being weekdays the heaviest ones as at
          weekends I spend some time with my husband. As I mentioned before, I
          feel more proactive during the morning so I usually get up very early
          and start working until lunch or the afternoon depending on the day. I
          always have my lunch ready the evening before so I don’t need to worry
          about what to eat or spend time cooking.
        </p>
        <h2>Asking for help</h2>
        <p>
          When in need, I always try to google and find the solution on my own
          but if there is something specific that I can not find, I ask on slack
          chats to my cohort or to my facilitator. From the facilitators team
          what I expect is for them to provide the necessary support I need to
          foster my brain to think and help me see the problems or solutions I
          am unable to. I also expect them to recommend and advice to read,
          watch or listen to any extra- resources they think might be useful for
          me as part of my learning process and goal.
        </p>
        <h2>Scheduling info</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently under two important treatments, one is my acne which is
          something temporal, finger crossed!! and the other one is my braces
          which is a long-term thing. I have to see both my dermatologist and
          dentist once a month, I have the flexibility to make dentist
          appointments for 5pm, the appointment is very short usually 10-15 mins
          and with my dermatologist I can make appointments for after 5pm as she
          usually works until 6:30pm, this appointment is a bit longer as she
          needs to analyse how my skin in responding to treatments so usually
          takes 30-40 mins. Apart from this, I’m well schedule and free to
          devote my time to coding.
