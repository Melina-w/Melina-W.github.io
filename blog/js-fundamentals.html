        <h2>Differences between HTML & CSS.</h2>
        <p>
          Html is like our human skeleton, what we can see is just bones that
          are put together to create the internal framework of the body. On the
          other hand, CSS is everything that has to do with our appearance like
          the color of our eyes, lips and skin, the shape of our body and our
          height, among others.
        </p>
        <p>Here is an image for better understanding</p>

        <img
          class="comparison"
          src="../src/img/HTML vs CSS.png"
          alt="html vs csss"
        />
        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>

        <p>
          Control flow is the order that the instructions or statements or
          functions are executed in our code. It is similar to what we do in our
          everyday routine, after having a shower in the morning, we get
          dressed, have breakfast and go to work or uni. To regulate the control
          flow, in coding, we use loops which are in charge of doing something
          over and over again.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, everything will move smoothly, unless there is something that tell
          us or the code to do a different thing. For example: we overslept,
          covid-19 quarentine, or forgot to do the shopping. Things like these
          happen in coding as well, and in order to let our code know what to do
          next, we need to use statements.
        </p>
        <h2>Break</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine you get up, have a shower, get dressed as you do everyday and
          when you open the fridge, there is nothing for you to have breakfast,
          you immidiately stop your routine. In coding, will happen a similar
          thing the loop will continue until a break occurs. See on the image
          below.
        </p>
        <img class="positioning" src="../src/img/Break loop.png" alt="break" />
        <p>
          As we can see, the loop will iterate through 0 (get up),1 (have a
          shower) and 2 (get dressed) until it gets to number 3 (have
          breakfast), where the break is and loop must stop.
        </p>
        <h2>Continue</h2>
        <p>
          Now, what would you do if you can't have breakfast at home? go through
          the morning without coffee? I bet you won't. Well, I would probably go
          to starbucks on my way to work. In coding, when a continue statement
          appears, what happen is that the loop will jump that iteration and
          will continue with the next one. Pretty similar to what we did with
          our breakfast, we skip breakfast at home and continue to our way to
          work or uni. Let's see the image.
        </p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/continue-loop.png"
          alt="continue-loop"
        />
        <p>
          Here, the loop iterates over all the numbers from 0-4, it realised
          that there is a continue statement in number 5 so, it skipt it and
          continue its iteration from 6 to 9, as 10 is not less than 10, the
          iteration stopped.
        </p>
        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>
          The DOM stands for "Document Object Model" and it is used mainly by
          developers to add or remove and change stylings of elements from the
          HTML. If you can not remember what the HTML is, check the explanation
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way we can access to the elements through the DOM is by using
          JavaScript, which is a programming language, or by using j-Queries,
          which is a library from JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In HTML, we can add a "class" to an element in oder to apply an style
          (color, border, text-decoration,etc) or apply it to the name of the
          element (h1/span). So, when we want to reach that element using
          JavaScript, we can call the element by that className or name and
          manipulate it. If this happens, we will get an group of elements (an
          array) since there might be other elements with the same class or
          name. We can also use an "id" if we want to make the element unique on
          the page. So, we will get only that element and we will be able to
          interact with it through the DOM. Let's have a look at an example
          using a class.
        </p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/get-element-by-className.png"
        />

        <p>
          In this case, we are going to access our elements through the console
          and put them in a variable called "demo".
        </p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/get-element-by-className1.png"
        />
        <p>In this case, we are going to get an array with two elements</p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/get-element-by-className2.png"
        />
        <h2>Difference between accessing data from an array and objects</h2>
        <p>
          To explain this, let's bring the previous array example. After putting
          the elements on the variable "demo, we got an array with two elements.
          Now, what if we want to modify the first element, how do we do it? We
          have to use an index number,starting from 0.
        </p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/get-element-by-className3.png"
        />
        <p>
          If we want to apply changes to all the elements of the array,not just
          one, we can use a "for" loop, and loop throught every item in the
          array.
        </p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/get-element-by-className4.png"
        />
        <p>It will look like this on the browser</p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/get-element-by-className5.png"
        />

        <p>
          On the other hand, objects save the data into properties or keys and
          values (key:value) that can not be access through index numbers
          because objects does not remember the order of keys or properties.
          Let's have a look at an example on how to access object data.
        </p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/get-properties from objects.png"
        />
        <p>
          In this image, we can see that we have three objects with different
          data but we only want to access to the keys of the first object.
        </p>
        <h2>What are functions? Why are they useful?</h2>

        <p>
          A fuction is similar to a procedure that we use to perform a task.
          This procedure may take inputs and produce an output.
        </p>
        <img class="positioning" src="../src/img/input-vs-output.jpg" />
        <p>
          Functions are useful to avoid repeating ourselves while coding, so
          instead of writing the same lines many times, we just create a
          function and call it whenever we need the procedure to be done. For
          example:
        </p>
        <img
          class="positioning"
          src="../src/img/defining and calling a function.png"
        />
        <p>
          In the example we can see that the function "SayHi" has been defined
          and it will display a message "Hi..." together with the firstName and
          lastName that you provide when calling the function. If you write
          SayHi ("Meli","Waigant") it will popup "Hi Meli Waigant".
