        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <p>
          Problem solving is a key skill we will utilise as a developer. Here
          are some problem solving techniques to try when facing a challenge:
        </p>
        <ul class="post-list">
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <li>The rubber ducky method</li>
          <li>Reading error messages</li>
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          <li>Googling</li>
          <li>Trying something</li>

        <h2>What did I do when I got blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
        <p>
          Problem: I needed to access the property of an object but the problem
          was that the property was inside a variable and I did not know how to
          solve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing I did was staring at the screen trying to understand
          the task. After writing the pseudo code, I decided to start trying
          things to see if they work but I was not successful at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I thought the answer might be on the previous tasks, but could
          not find it either. And I ended up googling it but I found 2 or 3 ways
          to do it, and my question was which one is better? I googled that
          question as well, and found a few interesting blog post that helped me
          make the decision. In the end I succeeded at solving the problem using
          what I think is the most elegant way.
        </p>
        <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
        <p>
          During the process I felt confident I could solve it but challenged at
          the same time because I was going through the first issue of many of
          that day. Also, when I finish the challenge, I was really happy
          because I was able to control my emotions and I did not have the
          feeling of throughing the computer out of the window every time my
          "solutions" did not work.
        </p>
        <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
        <p>
          I learnt that I am able to learn and process new coding information
          after practicing and reading a bit about it, I guess after spending a
          while doing the same I will be able to type the elegant solution
          straight away but at the moment I do what I can and give my best. I
          remember when I started foundation, I wanted to learn faster because I
          felt 5 weeks was a really short time for me to go over all the
          content.Now, even though I still feel it is a short time, I am
          extremely happy with the way I am learning and putting things together
          as I am enjoying process.
