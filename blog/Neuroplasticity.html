        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          Before understanding neuroplasticity, it is necessary to understand
          the term; 'plasticity'. 'Plasticity is the ability of any structure
          weak enough to change by an external stimulus, however strong enough
          not to mould at a once'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity or brain plasticity is defined as the ability of the
          nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or
          extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or
          connections. A fundamental property of neurons is their ability to
          modify the strength and efficacy of synaptic transmission through a
          diverse number of activity-dependent mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding Neuroplasticity can help us realized that the brain is
          not fixed but malleable. Since new connections in our brain can be
          created to link new learning and experience as well as erased to
          eliminate old ones. It all depends on how much effort and constancy we
          put to create that connection through training.
        </p>
        <p>There are ten principles in Neuroplasticity:</p>
        <ul class="neuroplasticity">
          <li>use it or lose it</li>
          <li>use it and improve it</li>
          <li>specificity</li>
          <li>salience</li>
          <li>transference</li>
          <li>interference</li>
          <li>time</li>
          <li>age</li>
          <li>repetition</li>
          <li>intensity</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          How might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own
          benefit?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think I would engage with each principal of neuroplasticity in order
          to help myself create meaningful links that make bigger structural
          change in my brain, especially, through practising harder everyday in
          order to improve, challenge myself.
        </p>
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase our neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the ways to increase our neuroplasticity are playing video
          games as this will improve our coordination, visual recognition,
          memory, cooperation and team participation as well as reasoning and
          problem-solving skills. Another way is to learn a new language as this
          will increase our our vocabulary, multitasking and creative thinking
          skills. Also, not now but when possible, travelling is a great option
          to enhance our cognitive flexibility, inspire us, and enhance
          creativity. Experiencing new scenery and surroundings can also help us
          learn about different cultures and become a better communicator, both
          of which can have additional cognitive benefits. In addition, doing
          some exercise aerobic in particular, can lead to improvements in
          cognitive abilities like learning and memory. Last but not least,
          creating art can help us see the world in new, unique ways, benefiting
          our brain by enhancing creativity and improving cognitive abilities.

        <h2>Growth Minset</h2>
        <p>
          “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities
          can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent
          are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and
          a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” (Dweck,
          2015)
        </p>
        <h2>Something surprising...</h2>
        <p>
          What surprised me the most was the fact that a human being can be
          fixed mindset in some aspect of their lives but growth mindset in
          others. As well as the importance of growing up in an atmosphere where
          the growth mindset is stimulated. To me it is relevant since a growth
          mindset person will always value what they’re doing despite the
          outcome while the fixed mindset person will focus on the outcome (If
          you’re not the best—it’s all been wasted)
        </p>
        <h2>
          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h2>
        <p>I will integrating growth mindset into my learning journey by:</p>
        <ul class="neuroplasticity">
          <li>Viewing challenges as opportunities to develop,</li>
          <li>Trying different learning tactics,</li>
          <li>Cultivating a sense of purpose for learning,</li>
          <li>Celebrating growth with others,</li>
          <li>Definitely using the word “yet” at the end,</li>
          <li>Making a new goal for every goal accomplished,</li>
          <li>Takinf ownership over my actions,</li>
          <li>Being realistic about time and effort.</li>
        </ul>
