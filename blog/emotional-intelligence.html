        <h1>Is IQ more benefitial than EQ?</h1>
        <p>
          For centuries, researchers and philosophers have attempted to define
          human intelligence. In the modern era, researchers have relied
          on Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests to measure both what people know
          and how quickly they can solve problems using reasoning. But IQ tests
          failed to consider the full range of our thinking abilities. IQ tests
          don’t always predict success in school, life, or business, either.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in the last 20 years, researchers have expanded the definition of
          intelligence to include a wider skills and the concept of Emotional
          Intelligence (EI) emerged as a way to describe another set of thinking
          skills. Emotional intelligence refers to our ability to recognize and
          regulate emotions, and to use social awareness in problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, IQ tests and EQ tests may give researchers a fuller picture
          of human intelligence. And also, give us an insite on how to work on
          our skills to achieve our full potential.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          According to Robert K.Cooper, emotional intelligence also known as
          emotional quotient or EQ is "the ability to sense, understand, and
          effectively apply the power and acumen of emotions as a source of
          human energy, information, connection, and influence.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It Is the ability to understand, use and manage our own emotions in
          positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize
          with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. It can help us
          build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve
          your career and personal goals.
        </p>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          IQ usually refers to our intellectual ability. Some of the most common
          elements of our IQ include your ability to use logic to solve
          problems, plan and strategise, understand abstract ideas, learn and
          adapt to change as well as grasp and use languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, emotional quotient (EQ) generally refers to our
          ability to sense emotion in ourselves and in other people. It also
          refers to how we use that awareness to guide our behavior. In general,
          if we have a high EQ, we may find it easier to identify emotions in
          ourselves and others,empathize with other people,adapt our feelings
          and behavior to different situations, control our impulses, withstand
          temptations and delay gratification, resolve conflicts with others and
          communicate effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Both kinds of intelligence can dramatically affect our
          quality of life and our accomplishments. Understanding and developing
          both kinds of intelligence may be our best bet for increasing our odds
          of success in all areas of our life.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <img class="positioning" src="../src/img/IQ vs EQ.jpg" />
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence is important because "it is a way of
          recognizing, understanding, and choosing how we think, feel, and act.
          It also shapes our interactions with others and our understanding of
          ourselves. It defines how and what we learn; it allows us to set
          priorities; it determines the majority of our daily actions. Research
          suggests it is responsible for as much as 80% of the “success” in our
          lives.” — J. Freedman
