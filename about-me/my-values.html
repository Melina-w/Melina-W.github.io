      <h1>My Values</h1>
      <div id="content">
        <h2>Honesty</h2>
        <p>
          I think being honest is one of the most important value in my life
          since what I say and what I do can impact my entire life, my
          relationships, my jobs, my feelings and the actions I perform. For
          instance, when I first considered changing my career path, I thought I
          was crazy because I had built a really good career as a teacher, I was
          good at it but there was something inside me that was not alright. I
          wanted a different life for me, meet other challenges, experience what
          it is feeling frustrated but enjoying everything at the same time. I
          think that I have given the teaching industry everything I had but I
          was not happy anymore. So, I decided to go back to the area I was more
          curious about, and I’ve been discovering a totally different world,
          coding is my new adventure and I found it because I listened to myself
          and was honest.
        </p>

        <h2>Creativity</h2>

        <p>
          One of the greatest values I am thankful to have is being creative;
          even when I consider ideas to be a bit crazy, I go for it and they
          turn out to be successful. I remember having to plan a vocabulary
          lesson to a group of beginners in English, I had this idea of using
          kids songs to review the part of the body, so I prepare a set of
          different activities to introduce the topic, practice with some
          grammar and sentence production, and at the end of the class, I felt
          nervous because I didn’t know if adults would be fan of the idea of
          singing kids songs in an English class. We reviewed the lyrics
          together and then I played the song. I couldn’t believe myself the way
          they engaged to it, we ended up dancing the song and laughing a lot.
          This is just one of many examples I would like to share but I love
          trying new things to see what is like, changing my mind when things
          don’t work well, doing this has helped me collaborate with co-workers
          on projects, overcome difficult situations both personal and at work.
        </p>
        <h2>Perseverance</h2>

        <p>
          "ASPIRE to ACQUIRE the DESIRE that you ADMIRE, but if in the process
          you PERSPIRE, don't RETIRE but REFIRE to ACQUIRE the DESIRE which you
          ADMIRE" --- Chintan Jain (Original)

          Loving this twister! I feel so identified by it, saw it while reading
          a blog but I can’t remember which one it was. During my whole life, I
          have found myself in a constant learning process which I absolutely
          thank my parents for, they have always motivated me to study, work
          hard and do my best to achieve my aspiration in life. When I was 9
          years old, I was listening to the radio and all of the sudden an
          English song started playing, I remember being confuse because I
          couldn’t understand what it was about, but I guessed that due to the
          melody might have been a love song. After that, I started paying
          attention to every song I listened to and tried to figure out what it
          said, until one of my classmate told me she was about to start English
          lesson with a teach in town. I told my parents I wanted to learn the
          language to understand the songs and they thought it was just a joke
          but agreed to ask the teacher the content of the curricula and the
          timetables, amount of students, among other questions. I had my first
          lesson when I was 10, I studied English everyday and I have not
          stopped learning new words as I like keeping myself updated with the
          different variation of the language. Nowadays, I am bilingual after
          years and years of study. I think that a person needs to be in
          constant learning in all areas of interest in order to avoid being
          left behind. For sure the learning process is not easy and it will
          have many burdens one must suffer to become good at what they want,
          but with time and patient, everything is possible.
