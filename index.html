      <h1>Melina Waigant</h1>
      <h2>Entry-level Software Developer in Auckland</h2>
      <p>
        Recently graduated from sheCodes.io and currently doing a bootcamp at
        Dev Academy
      </p>
      <p>
        I am enthusiastic about facing challenges such as developing with the
        latest frameworks or working with complex business domain models. I
        consider myself to be a team player and a fast learner since I am
        adaptable and rapidly become productive in different environments and
        technologies. Furthermore, I work hard to get things done and constantly
        challenge my solutions to make them scalable, efficient, robust,
        well-architected and documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through experience working with classmates in different projects, I have
        developed solid interpersonal skills with the ability to interface with
        individuals at all levels, contribute to teamwork, mentor other member
        of the development team, manage projects and build prolific customer
        relationships. I am keen on gaining more software development experience
        in New Zealand and I am currently looking for a job in a full stack
        developer role where I can use my skills and my proactivity to
        contribute to achieve business goals, work with modern technologies and
        increase my technical and interpersonal abilities.
