        <h1>Relative, absolute, and fixed positioning</h1>
        <p>
          Positioning sets how an element is positioned in a document, that is
          to say make elements behave differently. For example, sitting one
          element on top of another one or at the very top of the page and to do
          this, the top, right, bottom and left properties will be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The position property can take different values like relative,
          absolute and fixed but you might be wondering what are the different
          between them. Let’s get started!
        </p>
        <h2>{position: relative;}</h2>

        <p>
          An element with position relative will follow the normal flow of the
          webpage, so the element is relative to itself. For instance, let’s say
          we want to set position relative to another element on the page.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../src/img/CSS.Position Relative.png"
          alt="css.position-relative"
          class="positioning"
        />
        <p>
          As shown on the img, we need to set a positioning attribute (top,
          left, bottom, right) since otherwise, it won’t have any effect on the
          positioning at all. In this case the attribute top:50px was set which
          means the element will shift its position 50px down from where it
          would normally be.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../src/img/Position Relative.png"
          alt="html.position-Relative"
          class="positioning"
        />
        <h2>{position: absolute;}</h2>
        <p>
          This is a powerful type of positioning as the element with absolute
          position is taken out of the normal flow of the website and other
          elements are position as if the absolute element does not exist.
          Another characteristic to have in mind is that the absolute positioned
          element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
          (i.e, the nearest ancestor that is not static)
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s have a look at the images below, we have 2 elements; one of
          them, the blue one, is the parent element and the other, the pink is
          the child element.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../src/img/compare Relative vs Absolute elements.png"
          alt="relative vs absolute"
          class="positioning"
        />
        <p>Compare to the following image:</p>
        <img
          src="../src/img/1compare Relative vs Absolute elements.png"
          alt="absolute-position example"
          class="positioning"
        />
        <p>
          A we can see on the previous image, the child element although being
          still inside the parent, it is positioned at the top-left of it. This
          is because we set the top and left attribute to 0px on the child
          attribute and position relative on the parent element. If we remove
          the position of the parent, the child will be moved to over the
          parent, following the grand-parent element (the body) which is as far
          as it can go.
        </p>

        <h2>{position: fixed;}</h2>
        <p>
          A fixed position element will work exactly the same way as absolute
          position with the difference that the element in this case is position
          relative to the viewport, or browser window itself. Fixed positioning
          is commonly used to make navigation bars that remain visible at all
          times regardless of the pages scroll position.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <img
          src="../src/img/fixed position example.png"
          alt="fixed-position example"
          class="positioning"
        />
        <p>And this is how it looks like</p>
        <img
          src="../src/img/fixed-position. Scrolling img.png "
          alt="fixed-position.scrollign img"
          class="positioning"
        />
